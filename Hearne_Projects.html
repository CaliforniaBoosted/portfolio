                    This was collaborative project where I got to work on a toy virtual train with our chosen theme of bread.
                    We worked on this project for 2-3 weeks and it was a lot of fun. All of the information on the project is covered in our presentation on the right.</p>

                    <h5>Type of Project: Partner Project</h5>
                    <p>The App Inventor Project was one of the first projects I did in CSE. 
                    This project was supposed to give us an introduction to how programming works via block coding. 
                    The rules were to pick a tutorial off of the MIT App Inventor website, but my partner and I decided that we didn't want to do that,
                    thus we decided on re-creating Atari Breakout from scratch. This was a really fun project and it taught me a lot about coding. 
                    You can see our official project notebook <a target="blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16f4RiMKdAPktSSGyc2e1-99QR3Z6cW4E1d7uAr2TvIQ/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>

                    <h5>Objective: Design a functional game on Scratch</h5>
                    <h5>Type of Project: Partner Project</h5>
                    <p>The Scratch Project was the first project I did in CSE. It was my first time doing any type of coding. 
                    As my first look into coding it was a wonderful experience. 
                    I loved how I could design and change the look of everything and saw the results I was able to achieve from my efforts. 
                    This was the project that really got me into coding.

                    and habitation for those humans on the planet in your narrative</h5>
                    <h5>Type of Project: Group Project</h5>
                    <p>The Another World Project was a very unique project in our IED class. 
                    It required us to build a narrative and create a world around it. 
                    My group and I had all created the narrative and set off to doing our assigned parts. 
                    The project itself was a lot of fun. 
                    It was the final project I did in IED. I'm very proud of it too.
