            My career goal is to study astrophysics/astronomy or a similar field to software engineering. 
            I plan on attending California Polytechnic (SLO), UC Berkeley, or UC Davis. 
            My interest in science and technology was stemmed from a little online flash game called Club Penguin that I played when I was 6. 
            My freshman year I completed my first STEM course (IED) and am currently on my second year. 
            I have created many projects such as: App Inventor Project, The Scratch Project, The Train Engine Project, and The Another World Project. 
            My dream is to become a successful computer programmer and potentially co-found a company. I would like to use my skills to create software to improve people's lives. 
            In the future, I would like to live in New Zealand and eat filet mignon steak with potatoes and gravy. 
            I work well with others and strive to get along with team mates. 
            I am a determined individual with a hope to change the world for the better.
